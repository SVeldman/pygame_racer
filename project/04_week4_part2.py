"""Week 4, Part 2 - A real, multi-turn lap. This is the finished game!

WHAT'S NEW SINCE PART 1
-------------------------
Nothing mechanically - every idea in this file already exists in Part 1.
The only change is `TRACK` itself: instead of three segments (a demo), we
describe a full lap with turns spread across the WHOLE race, not just
clustered near the start.

This is deliberately a great place to encourage experimentation: `TRACK` is
just a list of (length, center) pairs, so lengthening a straight, sharpening
a curve, or adding a whole new bend is just editing data - no new code
required. Try it!

Run it with (from inside the `project` folder):
    pip install pgzero
    pgzrun 08_week4_part2.py
